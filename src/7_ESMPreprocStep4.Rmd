# This Rmarkdown is based on the step-by-step guidelines for preprocessing ESM data provided by Revol et al., (2024) via their website: https://preprocess.esmtools.com/, and contains code from or adapted from "Step 4: Compute and transform variables".

#Load packages
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

#Read in the data:
```{r}
d <- readRDS("C:/Users/Walt/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/Projects/ASH/DVAL/Users/Walter/Preprocessing/Interim Data/EMA_and_baseline2.rds")

#Centering
#First, I create groups of continuous variables to streamline centering procedures (groups modified from Step 2 RMD -- the groups below omit categorical variables that were included in the original groups)

```{r}

#Check that grand-mean centering worked by examining the means for all *_gc variables (note: they should all equal zero)
d %>%
  summarise(across(ends_with("_gc"), ~ round(mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 4)))
```
#Person-mean center each variable (based on subjects' mean for each variable)
```{r}

#Lag and person-mean center each variable (creating a lag variable and centering its values based on subjects' original variable mean)
```{r}
d <- d %>%

                ~ ifelse(lag(.x) == 999, NA, lag(.x) - mean(.x[.x != 999], na.rm = TRUE)),
                .names = "{.col}_lag_pc")) %>%
  ungroup()

#Check that it worked by view a FeValues will not be exactly zero because the above code lags before it centers. The below output serves as an opportunity to check whether strange values or grouping errors occurred.
#Happy
d %>%

#A problem was detected in the above step: pleasant_lag_pc = 12.0. The below code is to troubleshoot. 
```{r}
d %>%
  filter(participant_id == 213) %>%

    lag_pleasant = lag(pleasant),

```
#Summary (5/16/25): Data from participant 213 is flagged due to their high degree of missingness (~92%) for 'pleasant'. Other participants with high missingness should be considered as well. If we want to keep

#Check computation: Step was integrated into the previous chunks of code. More can be done in the future with checking computation, if warranted.
#Lag scores: lag and lead scores for same day beeps were calculated above
#Common scores
#Below is an example of how we can calculate summary statistics for a given variable across participants. More can be done with descriptive statistics.
```{r}
d %>%
  dplyr::summarize(happy_gm = mean(ifelse(happy == 999, NA, happy), na.rm = TRUE))
```
#Affect scores: Step skipped and will be returned to following the identification of scores we want to calculate.

#Save current dataframe
```{r}
saveRDS(d, 
        file = "C:/Users/Walt/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/Projects/ASH/DVAL/Users/Walter/Preprocessing/Interim Data/EMA_and_baseline4.rds")
